# biof309_python_project_BING_YANG
python final project for biof309
Recently, I have tried to teach my labmates how to play Chinese Szechuan mahjong. They are really interested and wanted to learn how to play, unfortunately, there are not any apps for real mahjong. I wanted to write a small python script to deal tiles to four players a starter of mahjong playing. 
Directly run .py file, and four users need to confirm by pressing any button and roll the dice to decide the dealer position.
